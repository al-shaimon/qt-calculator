# Qt Simple Calculator Software

A versatile calculator application developed with Qt Creator, featuring basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and square root), as well as a powerful trigonometric calculator that provides function values in degrees (sine, cosine, tangent and more). This user-friendly calculator is ideal for both simple math and more complex trigonometric calculations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Qt Creator
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/al-shaimon/qt-calculator
2. Open the project in Qt Creator.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage
The Qt Calculator Software allows you to perform various calculations. Here are some usage examples:

### Basic Arithmetic
- Addition (+): 4 + 5
- Subtraction (-): 10 - 3
- Multiplication (*): 6 * 8
- Division (/): 15 / 3
- Modulo (%): 17 % 4
- Square root (√): √16 = 4

### Trigonometric Calculator
To calculate trigonometric function values in degrees, use functions like sin, cos, and tan.

### Example:
- sin(30) = 0.5
- cos(60) = 0.5
- tan(45) = 1.0
